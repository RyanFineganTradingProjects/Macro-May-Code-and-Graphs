Quick Project on Economic Indicators discussed by FOMC members and Sell Side Research

There is a pdf file that has all the graphs that I want to show with a sentence for the description.
There is a jupyter file with all the code if you want to replicate. I left in THS fundamentals at the end for some reason. I never checked the bottom of the jupyter notebook before uploading to GitHub. You will be able to replicate everything in the code except the Fundamental data of hte company becuase I took out the API Key.
